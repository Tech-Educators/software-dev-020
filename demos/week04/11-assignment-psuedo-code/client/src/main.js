// CREATE A FORM ON THE INDEX.HTML
// get the form as a DOM node

// create a function that fetches data from the server side
// loop through the data and display on the page


// write a function that POST's data when the form is submisted. 

// On submit, get values from the form
// Send the data to the server - the server will INSERT the data into our database
// MAYBE we could re-run the display function to show the new comment
